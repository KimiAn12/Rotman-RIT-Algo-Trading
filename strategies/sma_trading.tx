This trading strategy uses a Simple Moving Average (SMA) crossover approach,
combined with exposure management. 

The algorithm continuously fetches relevant market data, including bid/ask spreads, price history, and current positions.
Gross and net exposures are calculated at every iteration to ensure it adheres to predefined risk limits. 
Trades are avoided when exposure approaches these thresholds, maintaining a conservative risk profile.

The trading logic generates buy and sell signals based on the relationship between the SMA of recent prices and the current 
bid price. A buy order is tiggered whe nthe bid price exceeds the SMA, provided no position is currently held and gross exposure
remains within acceptable limits. 

Conversely, a sell order is placed when the bid price falls below the SMA, and a current long position is held. 

To ensure systematic execution and avoid overtrading, the algorithm enforces a defined interval between trades on the same ticker.

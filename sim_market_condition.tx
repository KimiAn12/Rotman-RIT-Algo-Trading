Market Dynamics and Fees: (Fee/Rebate Structure)

--> OWL & DUCK: Favorable for passive (limit) orders due to rebates for providing liquidity
--> CROW & DOVE: Favorable for active (market) orders due to rebates for removing liquidity

OWl: (High Price, Low Volatility)
--> Use tighter spreads when placing limit orders (0.1% - 0.2% of the price)
   --> Avoid chasing trends. Focus on small fluctuations
--> High inventory thresholds are acceptable given the low volatility

CROW: (High Price, Medium Volatility)
--> Incentivizes active trading via rebates for removing liquidity
   --> Spreads around (0.2% - 0.4% of the price) 
--> Need to be cautious of overtrading during periods of high order flow
--> Moderate position sizing due to medium volatility

DOVE: (Low Price, High Volatility)
--> Significant price swings (Potentially rewarding)
   --> Widen spreads for limit orders (0.5% to 1% of the price)
--> Reduce position size to manage risk 
   --> Volatility-adjusted positions are crucial 
--> Monitor real time volatility and adjust threshold for stop-loss

DUCK (Medium Price, Medium Volatility)
--> Use spreads for limit orders (0.3% to 0.5% of price)

Trading Logic Description:

The trading logic operates within a simulated market environment, 
focusing on spread trading and mean reversion while managing risk through exposure controls. 
Hereâ€™s how it works:


--> Exposure Monitoring and Deleveraging:

The system tracks both gross and net exposures.
If exposures approach predefined limits, positions are reduced using market orders 
to mitigate risk and free up capacity for new trades.

--> Spread-Based Order Placement:

For each security, bid and ask prices are adjusted based on volatility spreads, which differ by ticker.
Order quantities are calculated to respect long and short exposure limits, ensuring compliance with risk parameters.

--> Rebate-Driven Strategy:

Limit Orders are prioritized for tickers with favorable rebate conditions (e.g., OWL and DUCK).
Market Orders are used for tickers with advantageous market rebates (e.g., CROW and DOVE).

--> Mean Reversion Trading:

Specifically for the OWL ticker, the algorithm identifies deviations from the mean price.
When deviations exceed a predefined threshold, the system places market orders to exploit the reversion opportunity, 
buying on dips or selling on peaks.

--> Continuous Execution:

The logic operates in a loop while the market is active, ensuring dynamic adjustments to prices, positions, 
and strategies based on real-time data.
API request pacing is managed to respect system limits.
